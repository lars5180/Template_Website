<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Emma Larson. I am a senior at the University of Minnesota pursuing a B.S. in Technical Writing and Communication. I also have two minors, one in Sustainability Studies and another in Interdisciplinary Design. I am graduating this December, and I am still searching for what will come next. My hope is to work in sustainable design, perhaps sustainable housing, or environmental communication. </p>
